In December 2023 I joined Professor [Tomas Rodriguez](https://sites.google.com/site/tomasrodriguezbarraquer/)'s project to replicate [Rathje et al., (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2024292118) work on the effects of out-group targeting terms in social media platforms. Using a dataset of all the tweets done by the Colombian congresspeople (that had twitter accounts) in 2020-2021 we built a set of dictionaries of the out-group targeting terms, and after validating it, explored the incidence of out-word usage in both the virality of the tweets as well as the engagement (number of likes). We extended the analysis by tagging each tweet using the [BETO sentiment analysis model](https://huggingface.co/finiteautomata/beto-sentiment-analysis) and executed the same analyses.
