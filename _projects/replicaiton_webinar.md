Co-coordinated the [Webinar series: Replicating empirical studies in economics](https://replication.uni-goettingen.de/wiki/index.php/Webinar_series:_Replicating_empirical_studies_in_economics_-_an_opportunity_for_students) along [Jan H. HÃ¶ffler](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/discover-institute/jan-h-hoffler) and [Diana Soeiro](https://ciencia.iscte-iul.pt/authors/diana-soeiro/cv) during 2022. This was part of the [Philosophy of Economics Working Group](https://ysi.ineteconomics.org/workinggroup/philosophy-of-economics) of the Institute for New Economic Thinking *Young Scholar's Initiative*. We contacted various applied and theoretical researchers as well as students interested in replication and hosted several experts like [Robert Finger]() and Anna Dreber teaching on replication in their own fields as well as students presenting replications in which they worked on. 

We're currently editing a Special Issue to be published in the International Journal of Pluralism and Economics Education ([IJPEE](https://www.inderscience.com/jhome.php?jcode=ijpee)) with the replications of the students that participated as well as a comment on the webinar series.
