During 2023 I worked as a research assistant at the Center for Studies on Security and Drugs CESED at Universidad de los Andes on the quantitative evaluation of the substitution program PNIS led by professors [Maria del Pilar Lopez](https://sites.google.com/site/marialopezuribe00/), [Maria Alejandra Velez](https://sites.google.com/view/maria-alejandra-velez) and [Hernando Zuleta](https://academia.uniandes.edu.co/AcademyCv/h.zuleta). PNIS was one of the results of the 2016 peace agreement between the Colombian government and the most important guerrilla group - the FARC. 

I supported the quantitative analysis of the impact evaluation of the program. I worked alongside [Lucas Mar√≠n Llanes](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eKUIyD0AAAAJ&hl=es) and Alejandro Cardiles in implementing [Callaway & Sant'Anna (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304407620303948) difference-in-differences estimation as well as describing the deployment process of the PNIS program. Neither the results we found nor the replication package can be shared due to confidentiality restrictions imposed by the client as of February 2024. :
