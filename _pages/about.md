Eternal student, or *philomath*. Finishing my MA in economics at [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/). I'm currently interested in economic theory, complexity, epistemology, and open science. Oftentimes I work on junior research [projects](/projects/) by myself and also with my peers and whoever wants to collaborate. You can check my [CV in english](assets/pdf/cv_gustavo_castillo-english.pdf) and in spanish [here](assets/pdf/cv_gustavo_castillo-spanish.pdf). I still pity not learning bayesian statistics in uni.
