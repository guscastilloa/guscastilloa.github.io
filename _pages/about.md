Eternal student, or *philomath*. I studied economics and political science (awaiting graduation). I'm interested in econometrics, behavioral science, epistemology, complexity and open science. Oftentimes I work on junior research [projects](/projects/) by myself and also with my peers and whoever wants to collaborate. You can check my [CV here](assets/pdf/cv_gustavo_castillo-1.pdf).
